# Balancing the scale between over-effort and free-flowing beingness (concentration & softening balance more distinct)

Date & Time ⏰: August 5, 2021 3:38 PM

- Sit started with many thoughts rooted from the self of "low self-esteem", again not me
- Doing retraining of breathing patterns for 20 minutes was a great base
- I looked at the thoughts all pouring in with a sense of love and acceptance. This took laying down and not identifying with them (looking at them with a courageous sense of stoicism)
- The sit **ended** with a sense of satisfaction/discursive brilliance. While this is nice, it is only something to let go of and not indulge in.
    - Important distinction → The discursive brilliance *is the same* as the thoughts pouring out from the "low self-esteem" self.
- Asking myself the question: "Is there excessive force being applied anywhere?" is extremely helpful
- Furthermore, if there *is* any excessive force being applied, **the way to release that tension is by focusing on the point where it is**. Naturally, awareness to this point releases it
- I realized that while abnormal posture and the pain from it can be used as vehicle, balancing that object with the breath and any tension that arises causes too much dispered attention that leads to no progress
    - Trusting intuition here

# Strong points

- While dullness was there, I had a clear understanding of what was happening. The amount I've written in this document is indicative of that

# Daily Life

- I can apply what I learned today in daily life in these ways:
    - Working at computer
        - "Is there any excessive force being applied?"
            - As I ask this question, pay attention to any aversion to softening into that. I know that I *enjoy* clinging to work sometimes, so this will be important and more difficult to soften into as opposed to simply thoughts of low-self-esteem
    - The Self of low self-esteem
        - "Where is my breathing"
        - Look at the thoughts like Levi

# Focus → Concentration

- Because the distinction between relaxed effort and over-effort is more clear, I realize the balance that must be maintained between the two. In the past, I have always been honed in in terms of attention, meaning it was anxiety-rooted. However, now that I am making stillness strong, I have to return to concentration and make sure I make that strong *without tipping the balance too far leading to overeffort*
- **Question** → How do you maintain the balance between lightly remembering and over-effort on the meditation object?

# Focus → Investigation

- This is secondary, but I intend to check with MIDL how to investigate properly
