# What happened?

- Unlike yesterday, I started off with 20 minutes of belly breathing, as I noticed there was a shift to chest breathing.
    - This helped the main sit, where I did mindfulness of breathing, specifically checking for any sort of tension
    

# Focus

- Slumping posture is a distraction still, much like yesterday. There are two ways to handle this
    1. Sleep well tonight so that I can easily do mindfulness of tension in the breathing while **laying down**
    2. Figure out how to keep the posture upright so that I can have less distraction
    3. Use a pillow to support my lower back

Ideally, I am working on 1 and 2 everyday. I envision that I am getting enough sleep *and* I have found a **consistent, comfortable, and relaxing posture** that I can do mindfulness of breathing without distraction

- **Weakness**: Over-effort while mindfully breathing. This was realized and slightly improved today, but I intend to maintain this as a focus point in the practice. Moving forward, I intend to use the same tactic of maintaining a good posture (even if it poses a bit of a distraction) while paying attention to the amount of effort on the breath **and the posture as well**
    - **Question**: "How relaxed is the effort in this moment? Is there *excessive force* being applied?"
