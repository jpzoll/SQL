What was going on this morning?

- Constantly fighting and giving energy to aversion within the mind. This was due to **breathing patterns returning to the chest without me realizing it**

# What happened? (during the sit)

- Retrained breathing patterns for 30 minutes
- Guided Stillness for 30 minutes
    - Sat with correct posture
    - Body became extremely heavy
    - ***Dullness arose but I was not aware***

# Strengths

- (as the sit progressed into belly breathing) softening

# Focus / Weaknesses

- Dullness
    - Get more sleep
    - TMI breathing
- Mind wandering
- For everyday life
    - "Where am I breathing right now?"
    - After checking breathing, put energy into the current task at hand. If there is no task, then reside in stillness

# Notes

- Notice the thoughts judging the practice and projecting onto the future
- Allow yourself to "mess up" instead of neurotically trying to prevent a "mess up"
    - i.e. A single breath
- You are not your thoughts, feelings, judgements
