# Practice

- mindfulness of breathing
- Following the breath, feeling sensations, their locations, and the end and beginning of each breath
- Balancing effort (lowering when too high, increasing when too low)

# Content

- at the very end, mindfulness of breathing became VERY easy and long lasting when the breath was followed the ENTIRE way (not just the beginning and out). This was generated via becoming interested in the sensations, the coolness, warmth, movement, changes, etc.
    - This was connected yo social skills, following someone’s words/sentences all the way to “end” (aka when their done talking and it’s my turn to speak). following the ENTIRE breath from beginning to end is equivalent to being a good listener in conversation
- Not only was following the ENTIRE breath a prerequisite for sustained attention, but **relaxing the mind and BALANCING EFFORT was crucial as well.** This meant following the breath diligently, while at the same time maintaining peripheral awareness (no tunnel vision attention)
- In the beginning, the forehead was relaxed so much that it became ticklish. It seemed like “tension” was released, like a gate opening, releasing some sort of energy

# Focus / Action Step

- mindfulness of breathing again, seeing how long I can sustain attention
- What do I do with this concentration?
