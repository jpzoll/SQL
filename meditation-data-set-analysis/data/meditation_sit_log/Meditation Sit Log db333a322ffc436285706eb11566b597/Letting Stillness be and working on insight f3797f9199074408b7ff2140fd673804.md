# Letting Stillness be and working on insight

Date & Time ⏰: September 2, 2021 9:49 AM

- As I am sitting here, the words in George Leonard's *Mastery* are very clear — I was putting on my socks, shirt, and comfy pullover for work and realized how much I enjoy the process of getting to work. Even now as I am typing on the computer, I love hitting each keystroke being hit as I jot my thought down on the computer

# Sit

- Stillness Meditation (20-30 minutes)
- Mindfulness of Thinking (15-25 minutes)

- It's becoming more apparent how much "doing about doing" is the same thing as relaxed at the "source", which can be experienced in do nothing meditation or stillness meditation. You stop doing anything, *especially* the movements of attention that occur habitually.

# Focus

- Mindfulness of movements of attention away from what I am committed to doing in the present moment
- Love the process
- Accept negative vedana. Soften into resistance
- Stay planted and grounded in your intentions, like a mountain
